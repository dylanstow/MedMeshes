    "\n",
    "## Current Methodology - Geometric Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Goal: Determine stastically different distributions of geometric features between groups of meshes\n",
    "- Processing Result: Distributions of geometric features from scans in each group\n",
    "- Manual geometric feature extraction - vertex curvatures, normal vectors, surface areas, etc.\n",
    "- Attempts have been made to partition mesh into different regions (front, back, quadrants, etc.) but it is difficult to make partitioning robust without introducing human label effort, which is costly and can introduce bias\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planned Improvements: \n",
    "- Increase number of partitions and compare ratios between partitions\n",
    "- Integrate multiple geometric features, like surface area, into analysis\n",
    "- Include age and time between pre-op and post-op into consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges with Current Methodology\n",
    "- Manual feature creation is difficult (often wrong), time consuming, and prone to bias\n",
    "- Somewhat slow to calculate geometric features for each mesh\n",
    "- Difficult to separate noise from signal\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps - Classical Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to automatically find unexepcted trends within the dataset\n",
    "- Still requires some amount of manual feature extraction and pre-processing\n",
    "- Tens or hundreds of datapoints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Classical Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires labeled training data (e.g. normal vs Sagittal craniosynostosis, type of Sagittal craniosynostosis)\n",
    "- Create a model to differentiate between two or more labeled sets of data\n",
    "- Trained models provided a \"certainty score\" - confidence that a specific example belongs to a specific set\n",
    "- This certainty score can be used for diagnosis or measurement of post-operation success\n",
    "- Some models are \"explainable\" - reasons for selection can be extracted and used for manual and classical methods\n",
    "- Common methods: linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/LogisticRegression.png\" alt=\"Logistic Regression - Classical Supervised Machine Learning\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised Classical Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does not requires labeled training, but instead extracts underlying features in the dataset\n",
    "- Common methods - K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "- Clustering can be used to test geometric feature extraction correctness - do different groups cluster as expected\n",
    "- Clustering could also be used to create mesh partitions for comparison\n",

    "\n",
    "## Long-Term Goal - Deep Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- More complex machine learning models with multiple stages of processing\n",
    "- Requires more data (hundreds to thousands of data points)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Deep Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Greater accuracy and capability with larger datasets\n",
    "- Automatic feature extraction can produce better results with less human bias and less effort\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/ML_DL.png\" alt=\"Classical Versus Deep Learning\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Deep Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can automatically extract and analyze spatial features\n",
    "- We can map 3D meshes to 2D topology maps to utilize existing CNN algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/convolutional_neural_network.png\" alt=\"Convolutional Neural Network\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised/Semi-Supervised Generative Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- GAN: Generative Adversarial Models - simulataneously train two models that compete\n",
    "- Generative model - produce new examples that fit the features of the target set\n",
    "- Discriminative model - learn to tell if an example is real (belongs to training set) or fake (generated by the Generative model\n",
    "- Some GAN models can be parameterized/constrained to produce new examples with desired features\n",
    "- GANs could potentially be used to produce new 3D meshes of surgical outcome predictions, or cranial development if no operation is performed\n",
